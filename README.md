# slideslive-dl

- Use `create-slide-video.py` to download the slides and create video out of them. If it doesn't work, check the hardcoded parts of the urls.
- Use [`yt-dlp`](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) to download the videos from youtube. Links can be found in the source code of Slideslive webpage of given video. It can take also a link to youtube playlist (and use naming template then), download subtitles (even autogenerated) and embed them in the video file. 
- Use `ffmpeg` to merge the two videos together, as in `merge-videos.sh`.
```
for f in slides/*.mp4;
do
	num="${f:7:2}"
	ffmpeg \
		-i videos/"$num"-video.mp4 \
		-i slides/"$num"-slides.mp4 \
		-filter_complex '[0:v]scale=w=1024:h=572,pad=1024:ih+572:x=0:y=571[int];[int][1:v]overlay=0:0[vid]' \
		-map "[vid]" \
		-map 0:a \
		-map 0:s? \
		-c:s copy \
		-c:v libx264 \
		-crf 23 \
		-preset veryfast \
		"$num"-final.mp4
done
```
The
`[0:v]scale=w=1024:h=572,pad=1024:ih+572:x=0:y=571[int]` takes the video (`v`) at index `0`, scales it to 1024x572 and pads to width 1024 and height `ih` (original) `+572`. The video is placed on coordinates x=0:y=571, so that the padding appears at the top.

`[int][1:v]overlay=0:0[vid]` then overlays the result with video (`v`) at index `1`, placing it at coordinates 0:0.

`-map 0:a` takes the audio (`a`) from file at index `0`, `-map 0:s?` takes all the subtitles (`s`) from the same file. `-c:s copy` copies some subtitle settings, `-c:v libx264` uses this encoding for the video.
